          <p>Daughter of a world literary icon, wife of a count... but, more relevant than that, one of the most important mathematicians in History and one of the precursors of Computation. She is Ada Lovelace.</p>

            <h3>About your name</h3>
            <p>
              Originally Augusta Ada King, daughter of the English poet <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Byron" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lord Byron</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Byron" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anne Isabella Milbanke</a>, married to William King-Noel, Earl of Lovelace. Her mother only called her Ada, after discovering that Lord Byron honored a lover with her daughter's first name. And after getting married, she became recognized by her title of Countess of Lovelace.

            <h3>Love for Literature</h3>
            <p>
              Despite not having lived with her father, as her mother separated from him a few weeks after her birth, upon discovering his extramarital affairs, Ada inherited Lord Byron's appreciation for Literature. She also had a very imaginative mind which evidently influenced her studies and scientific career throughout her life. However, her mother did not approve of her passion for Literature. At age 12, she wrote and illustrated a book titled Flyology, which contained her ideas for creating flying machines.

            <h3>Influences and Inspirations</h3>
            <p>
              Due to the influence of her mother, who was a Mathematics academic, Ada also pursued a career in the area. Other great inspirations were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Somerville" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mary Somerville</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caroline_Herschel" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Caroline Herschel</a>, the first women to become members of the Royal British Astronomical Society. Caroline was Ada's friend and mentor, and was extremely important in bringing her closer to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Babbage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Charles Babbage</a>.

            <h3>The First Computational Algorithm</h3>
            <p>
              At the age of 17, Ada tried to become a student of Charles Babbage, who at the time was developing mechanical computer projects. Charles only stopped refusing her as a student when Ada translated a scientific paper about his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_engine" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Analytical Engine</a> from French to English, adding several personal notes. In the last of these notes, Ada wrote an algorithm that used the capabilities of the Analytical Engine beyond that predicted by Babbage, which is recognized as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note_G" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the first computational algorithm</a> in History.

            <h3>A Computer Language with Your Name</h3>
            <p>
              In an initiative of the US Department of Defense (DoD) in the 1970s, the Ada programming language was created. Originally developed to be the standard language for the DoD's embedded real-time systems. Over time, it was updated to be used to develop other types of systems. The Ada language was originally based on BASIC and COBOL, and was one of the inspirations for the creation of Ruby.

            <h3>Ada Lovelace Day</h3>
            <p>
              Since 2009, on the second Tuesday of October, Ada Lovelace Day has been celebrated. Created by technologist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suw_Charman-Anderson" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Suw Charman-Anderson</a>, this is a day to inspire women to pursue a career in the scientific field, despite sexism, as History shows that countless women have made essential contributions in various fields of Science.
